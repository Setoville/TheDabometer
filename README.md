# TheDabometer

The dabometer helps the user build the strength and conditioning needed to perform the optimal dab. 
It does so by encouraging proper dab form and counting successful dabs.
It can also be used as a tool for weight loss, as dabbing is scientifically proven to burn calories.
The goal of the project is the maximize the swag output of the user.

Cheers.
