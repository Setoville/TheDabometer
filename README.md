# TheDabometer

The dabometer helps the user build the strength and conditioning needed to perform optimal dance moves.
It does so by encouraging proper dab form and counting successful moves.
It can also be used as a tool for weight loss, as dancing is scientifically proven to burn calories.

Cheers.
